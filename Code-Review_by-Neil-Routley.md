# Code Review
## by Neil Routley

### Overall
* I am really impressed by how clean all the code is.  Everything is structured and organized very well.
* You have also included quite a lot of functionality!

### Suggestions
* I left some direct code suggestions about routing in App.jsx .
* Maybe redirecting back to where you were after login would be nice so you can continue with an order once you realize that you are not logged in.  Currently you have to re-search and click multiple times to get back to where you want to be.
